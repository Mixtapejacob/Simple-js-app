# The best way to learn about programming is to complete a project using that programming language.
This project aims to do just that—have you build a complete, fully functioning JavaScript web
application. Since you haven’t yet learned how to build your own API, you’ll be relying on an external
data source for this project.
It’s best to have complete projects that you can showcase in your portfolio. For this reason, it’s
important that you don’t limit your focus to JavaScript and JavaScript alone, but, instead, consider the
app as a whole, including high-quality HTML and CSS. Your app should not only work, but be
aesthetically pleasing and easy to use, as well. No one expects you to be a designer (nor to have the
perfectly designed app a designer would have), but your final app shouldn’t look like a half-finished
prototype.
In the following sections, you’ll find more information regarding the requirements for your app.
